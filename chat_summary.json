Initially, the user requested to add a \"Contact Santa\" form, to which the AI acknowledged and agreed to add it. The assistant provided several questions with two options regarding the placement and information required for the form, including whether it should be accessible from the main menu or as a pop-up and whether it should contain basic or detailed information. The user subsequently expressed a need for a \"Contact Master Chief\" form, and the AI repeated the feature request process, offering additional features such as real-time chat support and interactive FAQs.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, the user further requested to add a \"Hadoken\" button alongside the \"Pour Coffee\" button. The AI asked clarifying questions about the button's style, size, and functionality, confirming it would proceed with the requests. Additionally, the assistant provided the user with a checklist of other additional features they might want to consider, including an interactive 3D view of carpets, customer reviews, and advanced search functionalities.\n\nThroughout the dialogue, the AI consistently acknowledged each request and provided options for further customization, indicating a responsive and accommodating design process.",
