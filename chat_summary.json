The user chose options for a separate page for the form and specific basic information to be included. The assistant confirmed the addition. Next, the user requested a \"Hadoken\" button to be placed to the left of the \"Pour Coffee\" button, prompting the AI to seek clarification on the style and functionality of the button. After the user provided their preferences, the AI acknowledged the request to add the button.\n\nFurther, the user asked for a button labeled \"Pour Coffee.\" The AI then sought clarification on the button's position and functionality, and the user responded with their choices, which the AI noted. The conversation concluded with the AI summarizing the ongoing tasks and checking on additional features that had previously been implemented, including a checklist of desired app functionalities, where the user confirmed some and declined others. The AI tracked all requests and queries, expressing readiness to incorporate the requested features into the project.",
