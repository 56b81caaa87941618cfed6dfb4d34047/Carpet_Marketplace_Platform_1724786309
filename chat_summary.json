The AI acknowledged this request and offered additional features, which included real-time chat support, an interactive FAQ section, a newsletter subscription, an appointment booking system with Santa, a customer feedback form, and a live countdown timer to Christmas. The user was then asked whether they preferred the 'Contact Santa' form to be accessible from the main menu or as a pop-up, and whether it should include a pre-set message template or be a blank form. The user confirmed a desire for the form's accessibility from the main menu and basic contact information to be included. \n\nIn another part of the conversation, the user requested the addition of a \"Hadoken\" button to the left of a \"Pour Coffee\" button. The AI confirmed this request and asked about the style and functionality of the button. The user responded by emphasizing the need for consistent style with the existing button and expressed a desire for a humorous engaging message when clicked. The user also asked for a \"Pour Coffee\" button, and the AI acknowledged that it would work on adding this feature. \n\nOverall, the conversation focused on enhancing the app's functionality with specific feature requests, and the AI provided quick confirmations and clarifications to ensure successful implementations.",
